There are 152 short sonnets attributed to Shakespeare. Among them, the most famous ones are Sonnet 29, Sonnet 71, and
Sonnet 55. As a collection, narrative sequence of his Sonnets speaks to Shakespeare's deep insecurity and jealousy as a
lover, his grief at separation, and his delight in sharing beautiful experiences with his romantic counterparts.
However, few scholars believe that the sequence of the sonnets accurately depicts the order in which they were written.
Because Shakespeare seemed to write primarily for his own private audience, dating these short jewels of literature has
been next to impossible.

Within the sonnets Shakespeare seems to have two deliberate series: one describing his all consuming lust for a married
woman with a dark complexion (the Dark Lady), and one about his confused love feelings for a handsome young man (the
Fair Youth). This dichotomy has been widely studied and debated and it remains unclear as to if the subjects represented
real people or two opposing sides to Shakespeare's own personality.

Though some of Shakespeare's poetry was published without his permission in his lifetime, in texts such as The
Passionate Pilgrim, the majority of the sonnets were published in 1609 by Thomas Thorpe. Before that time, it appears
that Shakespeare would only have shared his poetry with a very close inner-circle of friends and loved ones. Thorpe's
collection was the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic work to be printed before his death.

Critics have praised the sonnets as being profoundly intimate and meditating on the values of love, lust, procreation,
and death. Nowaday, Shakespeare is ranked as all-time most popular English poets on history, along with Emily Dickinson,
Robert Frost, and Walt Whitman. </pre>
